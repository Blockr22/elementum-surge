## About

Context addon adds context menu items, when you open it on movies, or TV shows in Kodi.

For example, open context menu, select "Elementum Menu..." and then select "Play" and item will be searched by Elementum. 
Does not matter which Scraper was used for that item, is it local item, or virtual item, or added by another plugin. 
If Kodi treats item as Movie or Episode - you can play it!
